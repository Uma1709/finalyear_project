# üß† Superpixel-based GNN for Leukemia Image Classification

This project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNN), particularly Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to classify leukemia images using superpixel-based segmentation. We convert leukemia cell images into graph representations and perform classification between **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** and **Healthy (HEM)** cells.

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the **C-NMC dataset** consisting of thousands of microscopic blood smear images categorized into:
- `ALL`: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
- `HEM`: Healthy cells

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize, normalize, and denoise images.
   
2. **Superpixel Segmentation**
   - Applied using SLIC with 50 segments per image.
   
3. **Graph Construction**
   - Nodes = superpixels
   - Edges = adjacent superpixels
   - Features = mean RGB and texture per superpixel

4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Class distribution
   - Graph statistics (nodes, edges, degree)
   - Feature distributions (RGB, correlations)
   - t-SNE visualization of node features

5. **Model**
   - GNN model: Graph Attention Network (GAT)
   - Implemented using PyTorch Geometric
   - Train/test split with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

6. **Deployment**
   - Web-based model demo (Flask or Streamlit)

## üìä EDA Insights

- Class imbalance handled via stratified split.
- Node count per graph: 40‚Äì60
- RGB distributions are distinctive across ALL and HEM
- Features are moderately correlated
- t-SNE shows clear clustering for ALL vs HEM nodes

Sample visualizations:
- Histogram of node counts
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- t-SNE of node features
